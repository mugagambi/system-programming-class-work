Exercise 1: Write a program that will write an arbitrary number of strings to a file.
The strings should be entered from the keyboard and the program shouldn’t delete
the file, as it will be used in the next exercise.

Exercise 2: Write a program that will read the file that was created by the previous
exercise, and retrieve the strings one at a time in reverse sequence and then write
them to a new file in the sequence in which they were retrieved. For example, the
program will retrieve the last string and write that to the new file, then retrieve the
second to last and write that to the file, and so on, for each string in the original file.

Exercise 3: Write a program that will read names consisting of a first name and a
second name, and associated telephone numbers from the keyboard and write them
to a new file if a file doesn’t already exist and add them if the file does exist. The
program should optionally list all the entries.

Exercise 4: Extend the program from the previous exercise to implement retrieval of
all the numbers corresponding to a given second name. The program should allow
further inquiries, adding new name/number entries and deleting existing entries.
